# Experiment with IBM's Qiskit open-source framework for working with  quantum computers
# on OpenShift 4.1 / CodeReady Containers 

# This quickstart includes Qiskit Aqua 
# (library of cross-domain quantum algorithms upon which applications for 
# near-term quantum computing can be built). 

# Aqua is designed to be extensible, and employs a pluggable framework where quantum algorithms can easily be added. 
# It currently allows the user to experiment on chemistry, AI, optimization and finance applications 
# for near-term quantum computers.

# See bit.ly/marcredhat and bit.ly/marcredhatplaylist for step-by-step instructions
# on installing Open Data Hub on CodeReady Containers/OpenShift 4.1
# You just need a physical server with RHEL 8.1 or Fedora 30.
