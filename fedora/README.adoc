== Red Hat CodeReady Containers (Minishift equivalent for OpenShift 4.1 or newer)

== Draft lab guide showing how to set up the following on a Fedora 30 physical server:

- CodeReady Containers / OpenShift 4.1

- Ansible Agnostic Deployer

- OpenDataHub

- Process Automation Manager

- Change Data Capture with Debezium and Kafka

- Tekton Pipelines

The videos also include Fuse/Camel/SAP, 3scale API management and much more.


*Red Hat CodeReady Containers* brings a minimal OpenShift 4.1 or newer cluster to your local computer
(see https://code-ready.github.io/crc/)

*Ansible Agnostic Deployer* aka AgnosticD, is a fully automated 2 Phase deployer for building and deploying everything from basic infrastructure to fully configured running application environments running on either public Cloud Providers or OpenShift clusters.

AgnosticD is not an OpenShift Deployer, though it can and does that, it is however also a deployer that just happens to be used to deploy a lot of OpenShift and OpenShift workloads, amongst other things. See https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd

*Open Data Hub* is a machine-learning-as-a-service platform built on Red Hat's Kubernetes-based OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform, Ceph Object Storage, and Kafka/Strimzi integrating a collection of open source projects. See https://opendatahub.io/




The instructions below cover

- installing Red Hat CodeReady Containers on a Fedora 30  *physical* server

- using Ansible Agnostic Deployer to deploy OpenDataHub on OpenShift 4.1

- configuring SSH tunneling / port forwarding to access the OpenShift console, OpenDataHub etc from your laptop.

== Check Python is installed
See https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/python/multiple-pythons.html
[marc@fedora30 ~]$ sudo python3 --version
[sudo] password for marc:
Python 3.7.4

Create a Python virtual environments; we will use it later when we set up Ansible Agnostic Deployer.
python3 -m venv agnosticd 



== Add user

sudo adduser demouser

sudo passwd demouser

sudo usermod -aG wheel demouser
